# XOR Logic Neural Network

A Python implementation of a neural network that learns XOR logic using a simple feedforward architecture.

## Description

This project demonstrates how to create a neural network that can learn the XOR logic gate, a classic problem in the field of neural networks. The XOR gate takes two binary inputs and produces a binary output based on the exclusive OR operation. The neural network is trained to approximate the XOR function using gradient descent and backpropagation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Install the required dependencies: like python libraries

 
## Usage

1. Open the `main.py` file in your preferred Python IDE or text editor.

2. Run the script to train the neural network and see the results:

3. The script will train the neural network using a simple dataset for XOR logic and display the training progress, including loss values and predictions.

## Neural Network Architecture

The neural network architecture consists of:
- An input layer with 2 nodes (representing the two XOR inputs).
- A hidden layer with customizable number of nodes.
- An output layer with 1 node (producing the XOR output).

## Files

- `main.py`: The main script containing the neural network implementation and training process.
